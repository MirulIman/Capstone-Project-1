# 📊 Retail Sales Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **retail sales data** to uncover trends in customer purchasing behavior, product popularity, and seasonal sales patterns. Through **data visualization and statistical insights**, we explore how factors like gender, age, and product category influence sales.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
✅ Insights into customer demographics and spending behavior  
✅ Seasonal trends and product category analysis  
✅ Correlation analysis between variables  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains **1,000 retail transactions** from **January 2023 to January 2024**. It includes details such as **customer demographics, product category, quantity, price per unit, and total sales**.
